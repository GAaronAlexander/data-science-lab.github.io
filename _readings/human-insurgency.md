# Abstract
Many collective human activities, including violence, have been shown to exhibit universal patterns<sup>1–19</sup>. The size distributions of casualties both in whole wars from 1816 to 1980 and terrorist attacks have separately been shown to follow approximate power-law distributions <sup>6,7,9,10</sup>. However, the possibility of universal patterns ranging across wars in the size distribution or timing of within conflict events has barely been explored. Here we show that the **sizes and timing** of violent events within different insurgent conflicts exhibit remarkable similarities. We propose a unified model of human insurgency that reproduces these commonalities, and explains conflict-specific variations quantitatively in terms of underlying rules of engagement. **_Our model treats each insurgent population as an ecology of dynamically evolving, self-organized groups following common decision-making processes._** Our model is consistent with several recent hypotheses about modern insurgency <sup>18–20</sup>, is robust to many generalizations <sup>21</sup>, and establishes a quantitative connection between human insurgency, global terrorism <sup>10</sup> and ecology <sup>13–17,22,23</sup>. Its similarity to financial market models <sup>24–26</sup> provides a surprising link between violent and non-violent forms of human behaviour.
